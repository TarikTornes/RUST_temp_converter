## temperature\_converter.rs

This is a small project suggested by "The Rust Programming Language Book" in end of chapter 3.
This code transforms Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa by using the tools learned in the first three chapters:
- matching
- functions
- modularity
- partially the concept of ownership
