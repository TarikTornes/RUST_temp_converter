## temperature\_converter.rs

This is a small project suggested by "The Rust Programming Language Book" in end of chapter 3.
This code transforms Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa by using the tools learned in the first three chapters:
- cargo package manager
- matching
- io library
- functions
- modularity
- partially the concept of ownership by using String and string slices through functions
